It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that
8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%. If one complete new layer
is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?*/
