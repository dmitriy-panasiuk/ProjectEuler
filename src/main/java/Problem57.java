/**
 * It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.
 * âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...
 * By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
 * 1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
 * 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...
 * The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example
 * where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
 * In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
